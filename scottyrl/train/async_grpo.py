"""Asynchronous / off-policy GRPO. *** STUDENT IMPLEMENTATION FILE ***

Part 3 of the assignment turns the synchronous trainer into a small
producer-consumer system:

  rollout workers  ->  bounded queue  ->  learner
          (rollouts and updates overlap in time)

Rollouts therefore may come from an older policy snapshot.  Each result
records the version that generated it so the learner can reject data that is
too stale; importance weighting handles the accepted off-policy data.

``AsyncGRPOTrainer`` owns both the Tinker dependencies and the orchestration.
That makes its relationship to ``SyncTrainer`` visible without using callback
closures or a second object for mutable policy state.  Methods marked
"given helpers" own infrastructure such as policy publication and logging.
Methods marked "student helpers" are the producer, consumer, update, and
evaluation exercises.

Queue reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html
An ``asyncio.Queue`` with ``maxsize > 0`` is bounded.  ``await put(...)``
pauses a fast producer while it is full (backpressure), and ``await get()``
pauses a consumer while it is empty.
